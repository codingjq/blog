# CodingJQ Blog
A Repo for https://blog.codingjq.com

## Background:

I've never had the tendency to stick to journaling or blogging so I've always been apprehensive on whether to maintain one or not. However, after interacting with this [tweet](https://twitter.com/codingbeary/status/1672170829889536001), I realized that devs turn to WordPress all the time for their blogging needs. Surely, that is the easiest and most efficient way to get started and deliver your REAL product, blog entries, to the world. As for me, I can't help but be motivated to do certain things by hand and testing my ability and attention to detail. Also, I like to expose what I've done both so that I can learn from feedback and for others to learn from my lessons. After all, that's why I make videos. I hope you enjoy any content I made about this blog and the entries contained within! 

## Design:

If you read the tweet thread linked above, I suggested using a Flask backend since it's so easy to use so I decided to go with that.
