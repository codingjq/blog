# CodingJQ Blog
A Repo for https://blog.codingjq.com -- Not yet in production

## Background:

I've never had the tendency to stick to journaling or blogging so I've always been apprehensive on whether to maintain one or not. However, after interacting with this [tweet](https://twitter.com/codingbeary/status/1672170829889536001), I realized that devs turn to WordPress all the time for their blogging needs. Surely, that is the easiest and most efficient way to get started and deliver your REAL product, blog entries, to the world. As for me, I can't help but be motivated to do certain things by hand so I can practice fairly boring but useful stuff like writing SQLAlchemy Models (since I usually use Django when coding up backends in Python). Also, I like to expose what I've done both so that I can learn from feedback and for others to learn from my lessons. After all, that's why I make videos. I hope you enjoy any content I made about this blog and the entries contained within! 

## Basic Design Choices:

If you read the tweet thread linked above, I suggested using a Flask backend since it's so easy to use so I decided to go with that. For now, I'm going with plain templates and vanilla JS as I didn't want to spend too much time playing with React and I'd like to keep my vanilla JS/CSS current. Perhaps I will try a framework that is new to me like SolidJS or Svelte to update this blog. 

## TODO:

-Clean up styling (especially text responsiveness to screen size)  
-Write some real entries  
-Implement markdown parsing  
-Make the "new entry" and "entry edit pages" secure. For now, I will just expose the new entry page only to localhost and the blog home and individual posts to the world.
